# Security policy

## Supported versions

The available compatible releases are listed in [powsybl-dependencies](https://github.com/powsybl/powsybl-dependencies). In case of vulnerability fix, the main branches are first fixed. The fix will be available for the next release train. In case of vulnerability of high or critical severity, the previous and more recent version is patched.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please report any security vulnerability, suspected or confirmed, to the Technical Steering Committee [powsybl-tsc@lists.lfenergy.org](mailto:powsybl-tsc@lists.lfenergy.org). You can also report totally privately to the Chair of TSC [Anne Tilloy](anne.tilloy@rte-france.com) for high severity vulnerability. If the issue is confirmed, we will inform the library users and release a patch as soon as possible depending on the complexity.

In your e-mail, please give basic information about who you are (name and company), detailed steps to reproduce the vulnerabilities (some python or Java code, screenshots) and the effects.

For moderate or low severity security vulnerabilities, you can use public Github issues. 

Github automatically reports vulnerabilities in opening pull requests. The fixes are usually available for the next version, but could lead to a patch depending on the severity.

## When to report a vulnerability

- When you think that Powsybl has a potential security vulnerability.
- When you suspect a potential vulnerability but you are not sure if or how it would impact Powsybl.
- When you know or suspect a vulnerability on another project that is used by Powsybl.

## Security on new code

### Sonarcloud analysis

For new pull requests, we rely on Sonarcloud analysis that has [security-related rules](https://docs.sonarcloud.io/digging-deeper/security-related-rules/). The pull request cannot be merged if any vulnerability or hotspot rule is violated.

###  Powsybl governance

All the developers allowed to merge new code are committers. They are experienced developers, known from the community. They have this right because they are competent enough to. All pull requests must have at least one approval for merge on main branch. Some pull requests need two approvals when the impacts are large. Thus, all the commits integrated on main branches are reviewed and approved by at least one committer. The members of the TSC are all committers, its list is available [here](https://www.powsybl.org/pages/overview/governance). The other committers are:

- [Sophie Fransedo](https://github.com/So-Fras)
- [SÃ©bastien Murgey](https://github.com/orgs/powsybl/people/murgeyseb)
