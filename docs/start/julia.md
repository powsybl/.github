# With Julia

PowSyBl can be used in Julia by using PowSyBl.jl. 

The documentation does not exist yet as the implementation is still in proof of concept state.

The sources are available [here](https://github.com/powsybl/powsybl.jl) and the current implemented features and usage examples are exposed in the readme file.
