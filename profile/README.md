## Hi there 👋



**Welcome to the PowSyBl organization README**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is our organization all about?


PowSyBl (**Pow**er **Sy**stem **Bl**ocks) is an open-source framework, dedicated to the modeling, simulation, and visualization of electrical networks. The power system blocks can be used through scripts for a quick setup, but they can also be assembled to build state-of-the-art applications.

PowSyBl commons include:
- A human-readable grid model that is fully extendable and supports merging of networks;
- The ability to provide network area diagrams and substation single-line diagrams;
- The ability to read and write a wide variety of formats, such as CIM-CGMES, UCTE, IEEE-CDF, Matpower, PSSE, PowerFactory;
- The ability to run load flows, security analyses with remedial actions, sensitivity analyses, and short-circuit analyses;
- The ability to run dynamic simulations and dynamic security analyses;
- The ability to run complex and modular remedial action optimizers for European coordination;
  The ability to run and design optimal power flows.


A key feature of PowSyBl is its modular design, which is at the heart of the open-source approach. It allows Java developers to extend or customize its features by providing their own plugins.

More comfortable with Python? Use our PowSyBl Python binding called PyPowSyBl, which utilizes our industrial Java blocks.

PowSyBl is part of the [LF Energy Foundation](https://www.lfenergy.org), a project of The Linux Foundation that supports open-source innovation projects to accelerate the Energy Transition.
