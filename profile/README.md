## Hi there üëã



**Welcome to the Powsybl organization README**


![PowSyBl Logo](../images/powsybl.svg?sanitize=true)


üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è A short introduction - what is our organization all about?


PowSyBl (**Pow**er **Sy**stem **Bl**ocks) is an open source framework, dedicated to the modeling, simulation and visualization of electrical networks. The power system blocks can be used through scripts for a quick shot, but can also be assembled to build state of the art applications.


For example, PowSyBl can be used to create applications that can:
- Handle a variety of formats, such as CGMES for European data exchange;
- Perform power flow simulations and network security analyses on the network;
- Perform dynamic simulations on the network.


A key feature of PowSyBl is its modular design, which is at the heart of the open source approach. It allows developers to extend or customize its features by providing their own plugins.


PowSyBl is mostly written in Java, but the library is also made available to Python users via PyPowSyBl, the PowSyBl Python binding.


PowSyBl is part of the [LF Energy Foundation](https://www.lfenergy.org), a project of The Linux Foundation that supports open source innovation projects in the energy and power sectors.
